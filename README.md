# Case-Study-3
Identify drop-offs and suggest improvements in a User Conversion Flow
Example: https://www.fedex.com/

## 1. Identify Drop-Off Points:

**Navigation complexity**: Users may find it challenging to locate specific services or contact options due to the extensive range of offerings.

**Form length**: Lengthy or complex forms for inquiries or quotes can deter users from completing them.

**Response time**: Delayed responses to inquiries might lead to user frustration and abandonment.

## 2. Propose improvements:

**Simplify navigation**: Streamline the website's menu to highlight primary services and contact options, reducing the number of clicks required to reach key pages.

**Optimize forms**: Shorten forms by requesting only essential information and consider implementing progressive disclosure to make the process less daunting.

**Enhance response mechanisms**: Implement automated acknowledgments for inquiries and set clear expectations for response times to keep users informed.

## 3. Implement test cases:

**Functionality Testing**: Ensure all links, buttons, and forms function correctly across various devices and browsers.

**Usability Testing**: Conduct user testing sessions to observe interactions and gather feedback on the ease of navigation and form completion.

## Practical examples

**1. Identify drop-off points:**

**Broken links**: For example, I found a broken link that redirects to a 404 error page: /content/fedex-com/sites/cc/ll_cc/customer-support/contact.html. When users try to access this customer support page, they encounter an error message that states, "No resource found." This experience may cause users to abandon the site or lose trust in the platform, leading to a potential drop-off.
**2. Propose Improvements:**

**Fix Broken Links:** Ensuring that all links are functional is essential to maintain user trust and prevent drop-offs. This can be achieved by regularly scanning the site for broken links and setting up automatic redirects to relevant pages when content is moved.
**3. Implement Test Cases:**

**Link Validation Testing:** Add test cases that verify the availability of all links on key pages to prevent users from encountering 404 errors. An automated test could regularly check each link and provide alerts if any page is unavailable.
